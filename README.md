## Building samples code

Make sure you have configured the `webdev` tool.

- [With the Flutter SDK installed](https://github.com/flutter/flutter_web#install-the-flutter_web-build-tools).
- [With the Dart SDK installed](https://dart.dev/tools/webdev#using-webdev-and-build_runner-commands).

Go into one of the sample directories, get packages, and run.

```console
$ cd gallery
$ flutter pub get # or `pub get` with the Dart SDK
$ webdev serve
```

You should see a message printing the URL to access: `http://localhost:8080`
